Privacy Policy

Effective Date: 03/09/2025

Your privacy is important to me. This Privacy Policy explains how my app (“PayMate,” “I,” “my,” or “me”) handles your data.

1. Information I Collect

Personal Information: I do not collect, store, or share any personal information that can identify you.

App Data: Any pay rates, hours worked, and expenses you input are stored locally on your device only and are never sent to us or third parties.

2. How I Use Your Information

Since all data is stored locally, your information is used solely for app functionality (e.g., calculating pay, tracking expenses) and is not transmitted.

3. Data Security

Your data stays on your device. I do not use servers or cloud storage to process your data, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

4. Third-Party Services

My app does not use third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking tools.

5. Your Choices

You may delete the app at any time, which will remove all data saved locally on your device.

6. Changes to This Policy

I may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes to the app. Updates will be posted here with a new effective date.
